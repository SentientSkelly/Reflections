4-7 One would want to use a remote repository rather than keeping everything local when wanting input from other people, or when in a group project where working together and being on the same page is vital.
4-10 It would be beneficial to pull changes remotely because if a change is made to the file on GitHub that is undesirable, and Git is automatically pulling changes, then the user has to have this unwanted commit, and may sidetrack them to fix instead of doing what they were originally working on.
4-14 Forks are copies of a project in GitHub; clones are copies of a project that is taken from GitHub and put on a local computer; branches are different paths of commits in an individual project. One could use clone and fork in very similar circumstances, just fork is saved to an accessible online database and clone is to a personal computer. Branches are most useful for making multiple changes at once in a single project.
4-22 Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally is beneficial because that would mean the user has a copy of all of the most recent changes to the project without being forced to abandon any work they had been working on, and have these new changes on hand for when the user tries to combine the projects.
4-25 I would probably collaborate by sending the required project files to the person I am collaborating with, and tell them what I would like to change in the file. Getting a direct response from them will probably be easier, although almost everything else would be harder.
