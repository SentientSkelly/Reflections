3-5 When you initialize a repository, git bash creates a .git file.
3-8 The staging area acts as a temporary holding place before the files go to the repository, which allows the user to select a certain number of files to put into the repository, and allows some room for error when creating new commits.
3-13 You can use the staging area to check to see how much has been changed since the last commit, and from there judge if there has been a logical change before making a commit.
